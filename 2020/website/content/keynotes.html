                          <p class="text-left">
                            <strong>Abstract</strong>: Astor is a framework for building approaches that repair buggy Java programs.
                            Those repair approaches take as input a buggy Java program (having at least one failing test case that exposes the bug) and search for a patch that produces all test cases to pass. Astor provides twelve extension points that form the design space of program repair.
                            Using those extension points, program repair researchers can create new repair approaches or extend those included in the framework by choosing  existing components (among 33 ones) or implementing new ones. Astor also includes 6 publicly available  repair approaches.
                            In this tutorial, we will first discuss the main techniques proposed on the field of automated software repair for Java. Then, we will discuss how to execute repair approaches included in Astor framework, how to extend them, and how to implement new repair approaches reusing components provided by Astor.
